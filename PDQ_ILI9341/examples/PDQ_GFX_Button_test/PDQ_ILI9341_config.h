// PDQ_ILI9341 configuration
//
// You need to include this file above #include "PDQ_ILI9341.h" in your sketch.
// Check settings on lines marked with "<=".

// NOTE: These are typical hookups individual boards will vary, please check your documentation.
// CAUTION: While Adafruit boards generally always come with needed level-converters, I find many
//          other LCD displays advertised as supporting 5V only support 5V power (with a regulator).
//          They still only have 3.3V safe logic (CS, DC, RESET, MOSI, SCK marked with * below).
//          If this is the case you will need a voltage level-converter (e.g., HC4050, divider circuit etc.).
//
// LCD PIN	Uno (328)	Leo (32u4)  644/1284
// -------	---------	---------- --------
// 1  VCC	  3.3V/5V	 3.3V/5V	3.3V/5V	// +3.3V or 5V with on-board regulator
// 2  GND	    GND		   GND		  GND
// 3* CS	    10		   10		   4	// Could be any GPIO pin, but then need to make sure SS isn't a LOW input (or slave SPI mode)
// 4* RESET	  0/8/RESET	 0/8/RESET	0/RESET	// This relies on soft-reset. You can also use Arduino reset pin (if correct voltage).
// 5* DC/RS		9  		   9		   3	// Could be any GPIO pin
// 6* SDI/MOSI	11		  ICSP4		   5	// HW SPI pin (can't change)
// 7* SCK	    13		  ICSP3		   7	// HW SPI pin (can't change) NOTE: On Uno this causes on-board LED to flicker during SPI use
// 8* LED	 3.3V/5V	 3.3V/5V	3.3V/5V	// LCD screen blanked when LOW (could use GPIO for PWM dimming)
// 9  SDO/MISO      -		    -	   -	// (not used if present, LCD code is currently "write only")
//
//  * = Typically only 3.3V safe logic-line (unless board has level converter [ala Adafruit]). Be careful with 5V!

#define	ILI9341_CS_PIN		10			// <= /CS pin (chip-select, LOW to get attention of ILI9341, HIGH and it ignores SPI bus)
#define	ILI9341_DC_PIN		9			// <= DC pin (1=data or 0=command indicator line) also called RS
#define	ILI9341_RST_PIN		8			// <= RST pin (optional)
// (other pins used are dictated by AVR HW SPI used as shown above)

// other PDQ library options
#define ILI9341_SAVE_SPI_SETTINGS 0     // <= 0/1 with 1 to save/restore AVR SPI control and statusregisters (required when other SPI devices are in use with other settings)
